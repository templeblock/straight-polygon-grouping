TriangulationTreeFaceMST.cpp [11/15/2013]
It construct a minimum spanning tree where a vertex is a triangle.
The weight of an edge between a pair of adjacent triangles is the edge saliency.
It then splits the tree into forrest by removing weak edges.

TriangulationTreeFaceMST_ES.cpp [11/16/2013]
After construction of a minimum spanning tree (as described above), it computes
the edge strength as the distance of two adjacent faces in the spanning tree.
